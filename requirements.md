# **🚐 "Nomad" V1 \- 2-Week Build Plan**

## **The Core Concept: "Living Map \+ Video-First Profiles"**

Instead of static profiles, every nomad is a **living, moving dot on an animated map** with video stories. Think: **Snap Map meets Tinder meets Strava** for van lifers.

---

## **🎯 The ONE Killer Feature That Makes It Mind-Blowing**

### **"The Living Map" \- Your Home Screen**

* Beautiful animated map showing:  
  * **Your position** (pulsing blue dot with your van icon)  
  * **Nearby nomads** (colored dots \- red=dating, green=friends, yellow=both)  
  * **Your route** (animated trail behind you, planned route ahead)  
  * **Other nomads' routes** (see who's heading your direction)

**The Magic:** Tap ANY dot → Their **15-second video intro** plays instantly (like Instagram Stories but for profiles)

* No reading boring bios  
* Immediate vibe check  
* Swipe up to see full profile  
* Swipe right to match/connect

**Why it's mind-blowing:** You SEE the community moving in real-time. It's alive, not static.

Let me try a few more searches to find any available audience data.Let me try to access the actual Social Blade page for her YouTube channel to get specific stats.Unfortunately, I wasn't able to find specific geographical statistics for Quin Gable's audience. Here's what I can tell you based on my searches:

## **What I Found:**

**Follower Counts:**

* TikTok: \~1.2 million followers with 30.4 million likes  
* Instagram: \~472,000 followers  
* YouTube: \~390,000 subscribers

**General Statistics Available:**

* Social Blade and similar analytics platforms track her YouTube stats  
* Estimated YouTube earnings: $3.4K \- $75.5K monthly (according to SPEAKRJ)

## **Why Geographical Data Isn't Available:**

Specific **geographical audience statistics** (where her followers are located by country/region) are **private data** that only she would have access to through:

* TikTok Analytics dashboard  
* Instagram Insights  
* YouTube Studio Analytics

These platforms don't make this demographic data public for privacy reasons.

## **What We Can Infer:**

Based on her content and brand partnerships (Under Armour, Clif Bar, Vessi, Spindrift, US Tourism Boards), her audience is likely:

* **Primary location**: United States  
* **Demographics**: Predominantly female, ages 18-34  
* **Interests**: Solo female travel, van life, outdoor adventure, hiking, pet content

To get actual geographical stats, you would need to either contact her directly for a media kit or work with her management for brand partnership opportunities, where this data is typically shared.
